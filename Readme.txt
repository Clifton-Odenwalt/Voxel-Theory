# Voxel Theory

**An Ontological Replacement for Spacetime and Quantum Metaphysics**  
by *Clifton Odenwalt* and *ChatGPT*

## 📘 Overview

**Voxel Theory** is a first-principle framework that reconstructs physics from the ground up — not by extending General Relativity or Quantum Mechanics, but by replacing their underlying metaphysical assumptions entirely.

- **Spacetime is not real** — it is a coordinate metaphor for causal propagation.
- **Quantum behavior is not fundamental** — it emerges from voxel stress interactions.
- **Forces, particles, fields, and even time** emerge from discrete causal dynamics between volumetric elements: **voxels**.

This theory eliminates the need for virtual particles, gauge symmetry, Hilbert spaces, and wavefunction collapse — providing instead a **fully causal, mechanically grounded model** of motion, mass, field behavior, and structure.

## 🔍 Core Claims

- **Time is not a dimension** — it is an illusion of causal voxel sequencing.
- **Mass emerges** from voxel stress density — not from Higgs fields.
- **Motion and inertia** are the result of directional shear across voxel fields.
- **Quantization** is emergent, not axiomatic.
- **The universe is not expanding** — redshift is a causal delay from voxel compression and interlock.
- **All physics emerges** from local voxel interactions — no metaphysical scaffolding required.
